                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name “Shih Tzu” means little lion, but there’s nothing fierce about this dog breed. This pooch is a lover, not a hunter.

            <p class="p">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bred solely to be companions, Shih Tzus are affectionate, happy, outgoing house dogs who love nothing more than to follow their people from room to room. Since ancient times, they’ve made themselves comfortable on the laps of people from all walks of life, even emperors!

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, however, pet parents have started taking Shih Tzus off their laps and into dog sports, training them for obedience, rally, and agility competitions. They make great family pets who get along with other animals and even children, so long as kids know how to gently handle and play with a small pup.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you’re looking for a small best buddy who can adapt to apartment living, join you on the couch for cuddles, and shower you with unconditional love, this may be the dog for you.
